#+TITLE Dotfiles

* Dotfiles repo, stored at =~/.config=.

* Prerequisites
The ~$ZDOTDIR~ environment variable has to be pointing to =~/.config/zsh= for the
config files there to work. I edit a global env file to accomplish this, but
this isn't good style.

~.zshenv~ also sets a lot of environment variables to get other applications to
put configuration files in =~/.config=, =~/.cache=, and =~/.local/share=.

I make symlinks from =~/.xinitrc= to =~/.config/x11/xinitrc=, and from
=~/.emacs.d= to =~/.config/emacs=.

I use Doom Emacs, so all the configuration is in =~/.config/doom= and not
=~/.config/emacs=.
